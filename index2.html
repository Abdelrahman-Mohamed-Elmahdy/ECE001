   <h3>History of AI</h3>
   <p style="font-size:16px"> The field of AI research was born at a workshop in school in 1956, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy to inform apart the world from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist mathematician. Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing" computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the everyday human), solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English. By the middle of the 1960s, research within the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world.[40] AI's founders were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted, "machines are capable, within twenty years, of doing any work an individual can do". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the matter of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved. They didn't recognize the problem of variety of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Light hill and ongoing pressure from the us Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments bring back a halt exploratory research in AI. the subsequent few years would later be called an "AI winter a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.
